A MAST nod to Voices Seen 2019 finalist _Love or Something_, an animated film by David Scott Heath.

> _Love or Something_ is my attempt to capture the complicated nature of human feelings and communication. Adapted from a section of Albert Camus' _The Stranger_, I utilized a variety of different mediums and styles to express the way people's fickle natures can cause their attitudes to shift from moment to moment. I hope you all can enjoy and take something away from this small work of mine.
