MAST awards its 2019 Micro-docs Grand Prize to _Warrior_, a film by Cole Sax.

> Jenny's will to survive makes this story profound. Her warrior mentality kept her going in what could have been her final moments. We wanted to highlight her as a survivor rather than a victim. While Jenny suffered a lifetime's worth of pain, she did not let the abuse end her life. 

> From here we hope to continue working alongside non-profits and encourage them to invest in the power of film by partnering with for-profit organizations.
