A MAST nod to Andrew Goldsmith's & Bradley Slabe's beautifully animated short, _Lost and Found_.

**What inspired the theme of "Lost and Found", and how does it vary from your other work?**

**Andrew:** We were inspired by the Japanese philosophies of Wabi Sabi, which celebrates the beauty of impermanence, incompleteness and imperfection. It varies with much of my other work in that its much more melancholy and bittersweet, but I wouldn't say it differs hugely from the rest of my work, perhaps since I make a lot of commercials they are often cleaner and more slick and not as rough and organic as a longer form stop motion starring characters made of wool turned out to be.
