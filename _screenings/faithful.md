A MAST nod to Micro-docs 2019 finalist _Faithful_, a film by Jenn Lee Smith. We present here the trailer.

> Faithful was born out of the need to better understand lesbian Mormons - some of the most invisible people in the world. Over the past several decades, at least 20 movies and documentaries have been made about the gay Mormon experience, but almost no films have been made about Mormon lesbians. The film has been invited and shown in LGBTQ+ community events all over the world reflecting on the quiet universal pain of those who feel they can only choose between their religion or their sexual orientation, but not both.
