EXT. SALT LAKE CITY STREET - 11:03PM

A young black man, TERENCE (mid -20s), is walking down the
street toting a duffle bag. He looks far away as he walks,
his gaze somewhere, but definitely not here.

<center>VOICE OVER</center>
<block>
I never thought I'd actually be
homeless. But when I saw it coming,I
felt the fear, I felt it all slipping
through my fingers, my small savings
drying up, the car payments and rent
payments and the cheap ramen and
toilet paper costs, until somehow here
I was on this very night with all my
belongings, leaving my apartment,
trying to at least get a shower
somewhere.

He turns the corner and walks into an obnoxiously brightly
lit fitness center.

INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS STUDIO

Terence walks up to the counter. He tries to make eye contact
with the guy at the front desk wearing a backwards hat, but
the guy is too busy looking at his phone. Before Terence has
a chance to speak up, the guy suddenly lets out a loud,
obnoxious laugh and slaps his leg.

<center>FRONT DESK GUY</center>
<block>
NO WAY, NO WAYYYY BRO! Not the fat
chick!!!
</block>

Terence squints his eyes in confusion.

<center>TERENCE</center>
<block>
Uh... excuse me, can I get a gym
membership?
</block>

The guy keeps looking down at his phone for a second after
Terence says this, then says:

<center>FRONT DESK GUY</center>
<block>Sup?</block>

<center>TERENCE</center>
<block>...I want to get a membership</block>

<center>FRONT DESK GUY</center>
<block>
Ohh ok, lit. You want the mega buff or
just the buff package?
</block>

<center>TERENCE</center>
<block>
I'll... just get the "buff"
package...how much is that?
</block>

<center>FRONT DESK GUY</center>
<block>$29.99 per month.</block>

Pause. The front desk guy looks back down at his phone, takes
out a vape pen and inhales deeply, then coughs loudly while
also laughing at the video he's watching.

Terence's brows furrow as he takes out his wallet, looks into
it and thumbs through bills. $30.00 even. He exhales and puts
the wallet back in his pocket.
