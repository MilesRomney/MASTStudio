> Ever play the floor is lava?  This cartoon series was developed with that concept in mind. I helped build out the pitch and characters in a world that became this reel.This was a piece I was contracted to direct and work on for a cartoon pitch. The music, characters and property belong to Matt, Jordan, and Ryan Augustine. It was a submission during Kidscreen in New York.
