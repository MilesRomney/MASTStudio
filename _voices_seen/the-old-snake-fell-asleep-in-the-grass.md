MAST awards its 2019 Voices Seen Grand Prize to 6 animators, including Dominica Harrison for _The Old Snake Fell Asleep In The Grass_.

It's part of <a href="https://www.preschoolpoets.org/poems" target="_NEW">_Preschool Poets_</a>, a series of eight short animated films based on poems composed by four and five year olds.

Conceived and produced by artist and poetry teacher Nancy Kangas and filmmaker Josh Kun, the project is based on Nancy's work with preschoolers at Columbus Early Learning Center, in Ohio. They selected eight beautiful, startling poems to be recited by the children and adapted by animation artists from around the world.
