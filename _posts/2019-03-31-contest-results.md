At MAST, we believe we're all defined by our stories. So we kicked off our program in 2019 with a call for stories of various kinds: documentaries, animations, and the written word paired with photography. We could not be more pleased with the results. We're based in Salt Lake City, and many of our submissions came from locals, here. But we also saw submissions from as far off as Brazil, and Belarus. We saw a breathtaking diversity of story and contest—precisely what we'd hoped to see. The power or regional filmmaking is all about that, it's all in the variety of cultures, backgrounds, beliefs, and lifestyles that come to bear in writing and producing stories that make people think a little differently.

The decisions were difficult. But in the end, the judges made their selections. And the lineup of both finalists and award winners is formidable.
